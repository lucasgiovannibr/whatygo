package send_service

// Sticker payload handling.
//
// `SendSticker` used to run every sticker through `convertToWebP`: fetch the URL, decode with
// `image.Decode` and re-encode with `webp.Encode(Quality: 80)`. That is wrong whenever the source
// is already a WebP — which is the case for every sticker that came from WhatsApp itself:
//
//  1. Animated stickers cannot be sent at all. The registered decoder (chai2010/webp) only reads
//     static WebP, so an animated file fails with `webpDecodeRGBA: failed` and the whole send dies.
//  2. The ones that do go through lose quality for nothing — a perfectly valid WebP is decoded and
//     re-compressed at 80%.
//
// So: if the downloaded bytes are already a valid WebP, they are uploaded untouched. Animation and
// quality survive, and the conversion path is left to the inputs that actually need it (PNG, JPEG).
